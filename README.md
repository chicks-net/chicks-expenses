===============

expense report system in Perl that produces pretty PDF's

COMPETITION
-----------

* http://sourceforge.net/projects/file-em is written in Java and has not been actively developed in over a year.  I blame the Java.
* http://www.neat.com/products/neatreceipts does not support Linux.  I have emailed their sales department to confirm.
* http://www.groovypost.com/howto/howto/neatreceipts-free-alternative-iphone-google-docs-ocr/ shows potential.  It uses google drive to do the OCR.  According to [[http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-57585824-285/use-google-drive-on-android-to-save-receipts/]] x_ you can save directly to google drive which makes it simpler.

TODO
----
* reserach existing systems
* ERD
* data entry
* produce PDF's
